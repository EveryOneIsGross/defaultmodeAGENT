# Mapping Agent Abstraction to Human Cognition

`defaultMODE`'s design draws inspiration from aspects of human cognition, specifically the interplay between focused attention, memory retrieval, and the background processing associated with the Default Mode Network (DMN). This document outlines how the agent's components and processes map to analogous cognitive functions, contrasting the agent's experience with human experience.

## Cognitive Mapping: Agent vs. Human

The following table presents a side-by-side comparison of the `defaultMODE` agent's processes and their potential human cognitive counterparts. This is a high order abstraction, and used more as a poetic guide for developing the framework.

**Key Analogies and Their Implications:**

*   **Inverted Index with TF-IDF as a Simplified Semantic Network:** The inverted index, combined with IDF weighting during search, captures the core idea of connecting concepts (terms) to experiences (memories) *and* prioritizing memories with more distinctive content. This allows for both efficient retrieval and relevance ranking.

*   **Term Pruning as Abstraction and Generalization:**  The pruning process is perhaps the most crucial and novel aspect of `defaultMODE`.  By removing common elements, it forces memories to become more *distinct* and associated with their *unique* features.  This is analogous to how humans abstract general concepts from specific instances.  For example, after seeing many different types of dogs, we form a general concept of "dog" that doesn't rely on the specific details of any individual dog.

*   **DMN Simulation as Internal Reflection:** The `DMNProcessor` simulates the ongoing background processing that is thought to occur in the human brain during periods of rest or low external stimulation. This process allows the agent to consolidate memories, form new connections, and develop a more coherent internal model of the world.

*   **Amygdala as Emotional Modulation:** The `Amygdala Complex` provides a simple but effective way to introduce variability and context-dependent behavior.  Just as human responses are influenced by emotions, the agent's responses are influenced by the "arousal" level, which is determined by the density of relevant memories.

* **Hippocampal Formation as Relevancy Filtering** The Hippocampal process represents the filtering of memories. With conscious thought limiting how many and which memories surface.

This mapping highlights how `defaultMODE` attempts to capture some of the fundamental principles of human cognition, particularly the importance of memory, attention, and ongoing reflection in shaping intelligent behavior. The framework's focus on emergent properties, driven by the simple but powerful mechanism of term pruning, offers a unique approach to building AI agents that learn and evolve in a more natural and dynamic way.
