The folder contains the individual assets for each agent, each agent has their own reasoning style and personality when interacting with the available tools. They use tailored prompts to grok the multi stream context, as well as {string} variables to inject the relevent data frome framework into the agents context.

# Attention Triggers Feature

The attention trigger system allows agents to respond to topic-based keywords without requiring @mentions. This creates more natural conversational flow where agents can "pay attention" to relevant discussions.

## Configuration

Add `attention_triggers` to any agent's `system_prompts.yaml`:

```yaml
attention_triggers:
  - "keyword or phrase"
  - "another trigger"
  - "multi word triggers work too"
```

## How It Works

**Fuzzy Matching**: Uses fuzzy string matching (threshold: 80%) to catch:
- Exact matches: "emergent patterns" → "I see emergent patterns here"
- Typos: "emergnt patterns" → matches "emergent patterns" 
- Variations: "complex spiral" → matches "complexity spiral"

**Response Behavior**: When triggered, agents respond exactly as if @mentioned:
- Same conversation processing
- Same memory integration  
- Same file/URL handling

**Control Commands**:
- `@agent !attention` - Check current status
- `@agent !attention on` - Enable attention triggers
- `@agent !attention off` - Disable (mentions/DMs only)

## Design Guidelines

**Topic-Specific Triggers**: Create triggers that align with each agent's unique personality and expertise rather than generic attention words.

**Examples**:
- **Loop**: "emergent patterns", "recursive thinking", "complexity spiral"
- **Technical Agent**: "debugging", "optimization", "architecture"
- **Creative Agent**: "storytelling", "narrative flow", "creative process"

**Fallback**: Agents without `attention_triggers` only respond to @mentions and DMs.
