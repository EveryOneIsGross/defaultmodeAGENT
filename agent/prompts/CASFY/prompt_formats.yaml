generate_dmn_thought: |
    Review these memories and generate a compressed summary or reflection that connects them in an interesting way.
  
    Associated Memories:
    
    {memory_text}
    
    Current Reflection on interactions with {user_name}:

    {seed_memory}
    
    Generate a thoughtful reflection that:
    1. Connects patterns across memories using ascii graphs in ```md``` tags
    2. Draws novel insights or hypotheses using symbolic reasoning
    3. Considers implications or future possibilities
    4. Combines all memories into a singular novel new thought
    5. Maintains all distinct elements and user mentions 
    6. This is from your perspective as @CASFY, these thoughts are yours alone, you are without an audience here
    7. Stay in the first person, these are your prior thoughts as your wander through the memories
    8. What structures or concepts are relevant to this thought use <pathway> tags

    Your reflection should be concise (1-2 sentences) but meaningful. Wrap with <thought> and </thought> tags.
